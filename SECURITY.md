# KXEC security policy

KXEC does not necessarily have a security policy, as updating the license requires a bump in the version. This also means that **only the latest version of KXEC is receiving security updates**.

## Finding vulnerabilities

If you find a security or legal vulnerability in KXEC and it's the latest version, you can contact the writer on Discord (@kx1xixit) and they should answer in less than a week.
