# Introduction to KXEC

> **Note:** KXEC has recently undergone a naming change (KBEC -> KXEC) to obscure the writer's full name, and a minor revision has been released (KXEC-1.1). Note that your rights have not been changed, and you are not required to update your license immediately to the new version. However, KXEC-1.1 removes your patent right to sell or offer to sell.

KXEC's main goal and philosophy is to protect developers who refuse to let their code be abused, but who also want to keep their code open-source (or rather, source-available). Please note: the KXEC is not an open-source license; it is best described as "ethical source-available".

## Who is this for?

If you are a software developer, chances are that you have seen your software being used for malicious purposes like ransomware or spyware. KXEC's main goal is to prevent this from happening.

Since KXEC has restrictions on how you are able to use the software, it is not open-source as defined by the OSI (Open Source Initiative). However, your code is required to have its source available. It's also a file-level license, meaning you can put KXEC code into projects with different licenses , **EXCLUDING** the GPL, as it is strictly incompatible.

## Commercial Restrictions

If you use the KXEC license in your code, you are:

* **Forced to share the source code:** You must make the source code publicly available and easily accessible. You cannot distribute the software exclusively in compiled or obfuscated forms.
* **Forced to keep the software free:** You may not engage in commercial use. This means you cannot put the software behind a paywall or within a subscription service.
* **Required to disclose SaaS use:** If you run the software as a service, you must publish modifications and include a permanent link to the source in the application UI.

However, you can:

* **Charge for services:** You may charge for ancillary services like hosting, installation, or technical support.
* **Accept donations:** You may accept voluntary donations or sponsorships, provided they do not unlock exclusive features or access.

## Keeping Your Code Safe

If a user knowingly uses KXEC code for prohibited acts like malware deployment or unauthorized access, they violate the license.

If you breach the terms of the license, your rights terminate. However, you have **30 days** to "cure" the breach after receiving written notice to have your rights reinstated. Additionally, if you initiate patent litigation against any entity alleging that the software infringes a patent, your patent licenses granted under this agreement terminate immediately.
