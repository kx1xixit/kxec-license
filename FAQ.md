# Frequently Asked Questions: KXEC-1.1 License

This project is licensed under the **@kx1xixit Ethical Copyleft (KXEC-1.0)**. This is a "source-available" license designed to keep software free, safe, and open for modification, while preventing commercial exploitation and malicious use.

Below are answers to common questions about how you can use this software.

## General Questions

### Is this "Open Source"?

Technically, **no**. While the source code is available and you are encouraged to modify it, this license includes "field of use" restrictions (it bans commercial sale and unethical use). Therefore, it does not meet the strict definition of "Open Source" set by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). It is best described as **Ethical Source-Available**.

### Do I have to pay to use this?

No. The license is free to use for personal, educational, and non-profit purposes.

### Do I need to use my legal name to use this software?

No. You may use this software, modify it, and redistribute it using a pseudonym, online handle, or organization name, provided you abide by the terms.

## Commercial Use & Money

### Can I sell KXEC software?

**No.** You cannot sell the software files, binaries, or access to the software (e.g., behind a paywall).

### Can I use KXEC software in a commercial environment?

You may use it internally at a company (e.g., for data processing or internal tools), provided you do not sell the software itself to third parties and you abide by the source-sharing requirements if you distribute it to employees.

### I am a freelancer/consultant. Can I install KXEC software for a client?

**Yes.** You can charge your client for your **time**, **labor**, **customization**, and **hosting**.

* **Allowed:** "I am charging you $100/hour to set up this software and $20/month to host it."
* **Not Allowed:** "I am selling you a license to use this software for $500."
* **Requirement:** You must provide the client with the full source code (including your modifications) at no extra charge.

### Can I accept donations?

## Ethical Restrictions

### What is prohibited by the "Ethical Use" clause?

You cannot use this software to:

* Hack systems you do not own.
* Spread malware, ransomware, or viruses.
* Conduct Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
* Perform mass surveillance on users.

### I am a security researcher. Can I use KXEC software for penetration testing?

**Yes.** The license includes a specific exception for defensive security research and penetration testing, provided you have explicit authorization from the target system's owner.

## Sharing and Modifications (Copyleft)

### If I modify KXEC software code, do I have to share my changes?

**Yes.** If you distribute your modified version to *anyone else* (including a client), you must publish the source code.

### I'm running this KXEC code on a server (SaaS/Website). Do I have to share my code?

**Yes.** Section 3.4 (The "Website" Clause) requires that if you run this software as a service accessible over a network, you must make the source code (including your modifications) available to the users of that service (e.g., via a link in the footer).

### Can I mix this KXEC code with GPL code?

**No.** The KXEC license places extra restrictions on the user (non-commercial, ethical use) that the GNU GPL explicitly forbids. You cannot combine this code with GPL code into a single program.

### Can I keep my changes private?

Only if you **never** distribute the software and **never** run it as a public network service. If it stays strictly on your private laptop for personal use, you do not need to share changes.

---

## License Violations

### What happens if I violate the license?

Your rights to use the software terminate automatically. However, you have **30 days** to fix the issue (e.g., publish your source code or stop selling the software) after being notified. If you fix it within that time, your rights are reinstated.

### How do I report a violation?

Please contact the repository maintainers via the contact information provided in the project repository.
