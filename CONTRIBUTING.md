There isn't much to write here, you just commit your changes to a new branch (or a new fork with a new branch) and create a PR.

You may want to install `npm` to run CSpell locally (via `npx`), as it's what we use to correct spelling, but it's not a requirement.

Running CSpell:

```bash
npx cspell "**"
```
